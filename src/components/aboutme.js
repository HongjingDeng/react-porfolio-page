      <div><h1>Hi, I'm Hongjing. Nice to Meet You!</h1>
        <p>I am a bilingual full stack developer with medical devices and overseas sourcing background. Currently, I'm based in Jersey. I love turning ideas into realities and hopefully creating something that makes people smile.</p>

        <li>Problem Solving: I can take vague problems and requirements and break them down into steps and solutions.</li>
        <li>Systems Thinking: I'm good at thinking abstractly and putting together systems with many moving parts.</li>
        <li>Communicating: I can explain things clearly, communicate problems quickly and write accurately and concisely.</li>
        <li>Organising: I can self-manage, work to deadlines, organise projects and present well-structured and complete deliverables.</li></div>
